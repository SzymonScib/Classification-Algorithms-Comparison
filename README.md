# Classification-Algorithms-Comparison
**Work in progress**
This projects aims to make a comparison of accuracy and confusion matrixes of the most popular classification algorithms. The classifications are made on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset dwonloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

## K-nearest neighbours:
KNN is a supervised learning classification algorithm that makes predictions based on the distances of the K nearest observations, as its name suggests. It is one of the most popular and simple classification algorithms in today's machine learning. 

The accuracy of this model is 96% and the confusion matrix looks like this:
